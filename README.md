# Belter

A videogame with 2D vector graphics, reminiscent of Asteroids.

## Instructions

F10 to toggle windowed/fullscreen, and cycle through available monitors.

## TODO

* tests should run with -O off, all warnings on
* application should always set -O. 
  How to stop this undoing the tests "-O off"?
  Is it just that the app turns it on in 'main()',
  and no unit tests call main()?
  What if/when we add an end-to-end test? A: Worry about that then.
